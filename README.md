### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects to include in my personal portfolio to demonstrate data analysis skills.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects which would require skills in python, SQL, machine learning, ETL process and/or cloud services related to analytics.
By the way, I have a master's degree in bioinformatics.

Thanks for stopping by!
